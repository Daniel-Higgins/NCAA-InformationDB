# NCAA-InformationDB

This program is a GUI based program that uses MySql, Graphical User Interfaces, HTML scraping, file readers, and various data 
structures to make a user fiendly intereface about college basktball.

This program initializes by reading a .csv file and .txt of information about NCAA schools and their respective conferences. 
The user is prompted with a login GUI. The user name and password is checked with the MySql database of all accounts. If the 
user doesnt have an account the user can sign up for free by creating a username, password, and inserting their favorite team.

Once a user is succesfully logged in, they can pick between conference history or school look up. Conference history displays 
a table of all the D-1 conferences in the NCAA regarding name, wins, losses, strength, final four's, championships, etc... . 
School lookup is a reference to any school the user types in. Once a user types, or searches for a school by conference, we 
display the school name, city, state, closest related schools based on location, total championships, years won, and total #1 
seeds.
